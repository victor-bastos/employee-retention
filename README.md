# Employee Retention: An HR Dataset Case Study

This project analyzes employee turnover using an HR dataset from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance. Employee turnover is costly for companies, with significant expenses associated with hiring and training replacements. By understanding why and when employees leave, organizations can implement strategies to improve retention.

## Objectives

- **Predict Employee Turnover:** Determine the likelihood of an active employee leaving the company.
- **Identify Key Indicators:** Uncover the main drivers of employee attrition.
- **Develop Strategies:** Suggest policies to enhance employee retention based on predictive insights.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of information on 1,470 employees, including demographic details, job roles, and performance metrics.

## Analysis Approach

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Building:** Use machine learning algorithms to predict employee turnover.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models using various metrics.

## Key Findings

- **Attrition Rate:** Calculate the overall attrition rate and analyze trends over time.
- **Demographic Insights:** Identify which demographic groups are more likely to leave.
- **Job Satisfaction:** Correlate job satisfaction scores with attrition.
- **Predictive Model:** Develop a model to predict the probability of employee attrition based on various features.

## Results

The notebook concludes with a comprehensive analysis of employee retention, providing actionable insights for HR strategies to improve employee retention.
